Project Abstract

A crucial role in healthcare is disease diagnosis, which necessitates the precise and prompt identification of diverse medical diseases. Traditional diagnostic techniques mainly rely on professional human judgment, which can be laborious and error-prone. The use of machine learning techniques to enhance disease diagnosis has gained popularity in recent years. The need for more effective and precise disease diagnosis techniques is the main issue this study attempts to solve. In the traditional diagnostic process, patient information, such as medical history, symptoms, and diagnostic tests, is frequently manually examined. This method can be subjective and time-consuming, which can cause therapy delays and even incorrect diagnosis. Algorithms for machine learning offer the ability to automate and streamline the diagnostic procedure, yielding quicker and more precise results. The methodology is broken down into different sections, including data collection, pre-processing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation. Patient records, comprising clinical information and the findings of diagnostic tests, are gathered into a diverse and representative collection. The data is then pre-processed to deal with missing values, normalize features, and deal with data imbalances. The dataset is parsed for pertinent features to get crucial diagnostic data. To train and evaluate the models, different machine learning algorithms are used, including decision trees, support vector machines, and neural networks. In the end, the expected outcome is an accurate Machine Learning System for disease diagnosis with high accuracy.
